The Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset contains product reviews taken from Amazon.com from 4 product types (domains): 
Kitchen, Books, DVDs, and Electronics. Each domain has several thousand reviews, but the exact number varies by domain. 
Reviews contain star ratings (1 to 5 stars) that can be converted into binary labels if needed. 
I decided to work with the Electronics reviews

Two models were tested on the same data and evaluated --- Logistic Regression and AdaBoostClassifier
